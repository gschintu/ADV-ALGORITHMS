== Problems

=== Problem 1
Give pseudocode to reconstruct an LCS from the completed stem:[c] table and the
original sequences stem:[X = <<x_1, x_2, ..., x_m>>] and
stem:[Y = <<y_1, y_2, ..., y_n>>] in stem:[O(m + n)] time, without using the
stem:[b] table.


== Answers

=== Answer 1

We can look at the LCS-LENGTH conditionals and change the PRINT-LCS to check if
stem:[X[i\] = Y[j\]] first. If they are equal, we know that the character is in the
LCS and we can print it. If they are not equal, we can check if the value in
the table to the left is greater than or equal to the value above. If it is,
we can move up in the table. If it is not, we can move left in the table.

[pseudocode]

PRINT-LCS(c, X, Y, i, j) {
  if(i == 0 or j == 0)
    return;

  if(X[i] == Y[j]) {
    PRINT-LCS(c, X, Y, i-1, j-1);
    print X[i];
  } else if(c[i-1][j] >= c[i][j-1]) {
    PRINT-LCS(c, X, Y, i-1, j);
  } else {
    PRINT-LCS(c, X, Y, i, j-1);
  }
}
