== Problems

=== Problem 1
Use aggregate analysis to determine the amortized cost per operation for a
sequence of stem:[n] operations on a data structure in which the stem:[i]th
operation costs stem:[i] if stem:[i] is an exact power of 2, and 1 otherwise.


== Answers

=== Answer 1
Let stem:[c_i] be the cost of the stem:[i]-th operation.

stem:[c_i = {(i, "if " i " is a power of 2"), (1, "otherwise"):}]

thus stem:[n] operations cost

* stem:[sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i <= n + sum_{j=0}^{log n} 2^j]
* stem:[n + sum_{j=0}^{log n} 2^j = n + (2n - 1)]
* stem:[n + (2n - 1) < 3n]

Thus, the average cost per operation is less than stem:[3n / n = 3] and
thus stem:[O(1)].
