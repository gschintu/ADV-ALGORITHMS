== Problem 1
Use mathematical induction to show that when stem:[n >= 2] is an exact power of
2, the solution of the recurrence

[stem]
++++
T(n) = {(2, text(if ) n = 2), (2T(n/2) + n, text(if ) n > 2):}
++++

is stem:[T(n) = n log n].

== Problem 1 Answer


To prove by induction, we need to establish a base case and then an inductive step.

=== Base Case
For n = 2, T(2) = 2 which is equal to 2 log 2. So, the base case holds.

=== Inductive Step
Assume the statement is true for some k >= 2, i.e., T(k) = k log k.
We need to prove that the statement is true for 2k, i.e., T(2k) = 2k log(2k).

Given T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n, we substitute n with 2k:

T(2k) = 2T(k) + 2k                                          \ 
T(2k) = 2k log k + 2k , text((by the inductive hypothesis)) \
T(2k) = 2k (log k + 1)                                      \
T(2k) = 2k log(2k)                                          
++++

Hence, the statement is true for 2k when it is true for k.

Therefore, by mathematical induction, T(n) = n log n for all n >= 2 where n is a power of 2.
