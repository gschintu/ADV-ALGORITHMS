== Problems

=== Problem 1
Use mathematical induction to show that when stem:[n >= 2] is an exact power of
2, the solution of the recurrence

[stem]
++++
T(n) = {(2, text(if ) n = 2), (2T(n/2) + n, text(if ) n > 2):}
++++

is stem:[T(n) = n log n].

== Answers

=== Answer 1
The base case is when stem:[n = 2], and we have stem:[n log n = 2 log 2 = 2 * 1 = 2].

For the inductive step, our inductive hypothesis is that
stem:[T(n//2) = (n//2) log (n//2)]. Then

T(n) = 2T(n//2) + n                           \
T(n) = 2(n//2) log (n//2) + n                 \
T(n) = n(log n - 1) + n                       \
T(n) = n log n - n + n                        \
T(n) = n log n 
++++

which completes the inductive proof for exact powers of 2.
