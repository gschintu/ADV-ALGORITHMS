* Now let's look at the problem of Single-Source Shortest Paths. Think about your
GPS...how does it determine the shortest route to a destination? One way would
be to enumerate all the routes but that would be enormous.

* We can use a graph where the vertices represent intersections, edges
represent connections between the intersections, and edge weights represent
how long it takes to traverse that road segment.

* For single-source shortest-path, we're looking for the shortest path from a
single source to all other vertices.

* Shortest path algorithms typically rely on the optimal substructure of a
shortest path. Intuitive.

* Negative weights

* Cycles
