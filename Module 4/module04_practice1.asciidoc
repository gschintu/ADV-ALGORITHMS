=== Problem 1
Given a weighted, directed graph stem:[G = (V, E)] with no negative-weight
cycles, let stem:[m] be the maximum over all vertices stem:[v in V] of the
minimum number of edges in a shortest path from the source stem:[s] to stem:[v].
In other words, stem:[m] is the maximum number of edges needed to
construct a shortest path from stem:[s] to any other vertex.

Suggest a simple change to the Bellman-Ford algorithm that allows it to
terminate in stem:[m + 1] passes, even if stem:[m] is not known in advance.

==== Hints
* Here, the shortest path is by weight, not the number of edges.
