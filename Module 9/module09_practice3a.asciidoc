Show that the dual of the dual of a linear program is the primal linear
program.


== Answers

=== Answer 1
Suppose that our original linear program is in standard form for some
stem:[A, b, c]. The dual of this is to minimize stem:[sum_{i=1}^{m} b_i y_i]
subject to stem:[A^T y >= c]. This can be rewritten as maximize
stem:[sum_{i=1}^{m} (-b_i) y_i] subject to stem:[(-A)^T y <= -c]. Since this
is in standard form, its dual is minimize stem:[sum_{j=1}^{n} (-c_j) x_j]
subject to stem:[(-A) x <= -b]. This is the same as maximize
stem:[sum_{j=1}^{n} c_j x_j] subject to stem:[Ax <= b], which was the original
linear program.
