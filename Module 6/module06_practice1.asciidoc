=== Problem 1
Professor Gaedel has written a program that he clains implements Dijksta's
algorithm. The program produces stem:[v.d] and stem:[v.pi] for each vertex
stem:[v in V]. Give an stem:[O(V + E)]-time algorithm to check the output of
the professor's program. It should determine whether the stem:[d] and stem:[pi]
attributes match those of some shortest-paths tree. You may assume that all
edge weights are nonnegative.
