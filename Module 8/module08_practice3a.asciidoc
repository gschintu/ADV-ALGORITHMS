=== Problem 1
Explain how to coarsen the base case of stem:[text(P-MERGE-SORT)].


== Answers

=== Answer 1
stem:["P-MERGE-SORT"] can be found on page 775 of the book. We would simply
change the condition on line 1 to check for a larger limit than 1 element.
Instead of returning on line 2, we would call a serial sorting algorithm on the
range specified.
